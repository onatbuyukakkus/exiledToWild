# Exiled To Wild #
#================#

EtW is a surviving game platform. There is a map which includes trees,lake,animals and weapons. 

Users can collect weapons to increase attacking power. 

Users may sometimes get damaged by both animals and other users so their health may decrease. 

If a user want to re-full his/her health , he/she can slaughter an animal or sleep for 5 seconds but becomes vulnerable.

Animals are friendly , if you don't hit them ,they won't attack you. You can't go through trees and lakes. 

However, you can cut trees to open a path. Users increase their level by gaining experience point. 

To gain exp. points users must kill other users or animals. Level of a user affect the attacking power of that user.

A user can hold several weapons in his/her inventory and that weapon has health. After overusing that weapon , it breaks.
